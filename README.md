# Covid Data Tracker

Amidst the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 here is my take on the coronavirus data tracker web app. This app is capable of comparing the rate of growth of confirmed , recovered and death cases of different countries .
The India section of the app has a graphical representation of states where tapping on states gives the respective data and more .
